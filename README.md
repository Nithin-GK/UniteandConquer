## Applications
<img src="./utils/faces.png" width="100%">

<img src="./utils/natural.png" width="100%">

We propose **Unite and Conquer**, where users can use multiple modalities for face and generic image generation.
    *(a) Face Generation*. Given multi-modal controls, We can generate high-quality images consistent with the input conditions.
    *(b) Text and Class guided Genearation*. Users can input generic scenes and Imagenet classes to generate images with unlikely scenarios.

<br>


### Contributions:

- We propose a diffusion-based solution for image generation under the presence of multimodal priors.
- We tackle the problem of need for paired data for multimodal synthesis by deriving upon the flexible property of diffusion models.
- Unlike existing methods, our method is easily scalable and can be incorporated with off-the-shelf models to add additional constraints

## Environment setup 


```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


## Pretrained models:

Please download the pretrained models using
```
python utils/download_models.py
```


# Training On custom datasets 

## Data Preparation- Training
You can train on any custom datasets by arranging the data in the following format. Please note that you can choose to give either one or more modalities
```
    ├── data 
    |   ├── images
    |   └── hair_masks 
    |   └── face_masks

```
The training command for including semantic masks as different modalities along with text is 
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
MODEL_FLAGS="--attention_resolutions 32,16,8 --class_cond True --diffusion_steps 1000 --large_size 256  --small_size 256 --learn_sigma True --noise_schedule linear --num_channels 192 --num_head_channels 64 --num_res_blocks 2 --resblock_updown True --use_fp16 True --use_scale_shift_norm True"
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0" NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1  torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port=4326 scripts/train.py $MODEL_FLAGS
```

# Testing On custom datasets 

## Data Preparation- Testing
You can test on any custom datasets by arranging the data in the following format. Please note that you can choose to give either one or more modalities
```
    ├── data 
    |   ├── face_map 
    |   └── hair_map  
    |   └── sketches
    |   └── text.txt

```
text.txt should be of the format
```
image_name : Text caption
```
An example would be:
```
0.jpg : This person wears eyeglasses
```

## Testing code
Test on custom data using:
```
python test_multimodal_face.py --data_path /path/to/data --face_map --hair_map --text
```

Please set the flags you need for the generation.
##  Instructions for Interactive Demo


##  Demo 


```
python gradio_set.py

```


Once you perform the above  steps, the models will automatically get downloaded to your Directory. One that is finished, the models will be automatically downloaded you will get a local demo link which can be used to tey the generation models on your own. More details about internal components of the code will be uploaded shortyl
